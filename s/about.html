            <p>Hey, I am Drainyyy.</p>
            <p>I am a 15 y/o developer and gamer from germany.</p>
            <p>I started developing when I was round about 10. </p>
            <p>Surely I didn't code good stuff. My sister told me how to write some print statements in java and I felt like a big hacker.</p>
            <p>I didn't learned any more programming until I was 12 and started with skidding Minecraft plugins.</p>
            <p>I haven't learned the basics of programming so wasn't able to do shit alone. But I didn't want to learn java from beginning so I decided to go the skid way.
                I started to skid discord bots and when I noticed that I can't do things alone I decided to learn python.</p>
            <p>Python was the first language I learned from beginning I really like it. So I started some projects in Python, 
                but none of them were completed except <a href="../p/ToxicBot.html">ToxicBot</a>. With the rework of Toxic I learned how to work with Postgresql, APIs etc.</p>
            <p>Then I started learning Java from beginning and here I am. A mediocre developer.</p>
