								<h3>Our history</h3>
								<p>
									jule.agency was invented back in the end of 2019 by two teenagers named jule (that's why it's called jule.agency)
									and jeorg. These two guys just joked about how to get famous on instagram and then they found out that jule is pretty good
									in managing a social media account. She knew how people would react to special pictures and stuff so she said she could
									do this as a job and that's the hour where the idea of jule.agency was born.
